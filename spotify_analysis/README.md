Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:

üó∫Ô∏è Explore: Which artists and genres are the most popular?
üìä Visualize: Visualize the numeric values as a time-series by year. Can you spot any changes over the years?
üîé Analyze: Train and build a classifier to predict a song's genre based on columns 3 to 13.
Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:

Your friend, who is an aspiring musician, wants to make a hit song and has asked you to use your data skills to help her. You have decided to analyze what makes a top song, keeping in mind changes over the years. What concrete recommendations can you give her before she writes lyrics, makes beats, and records the song? She's open to any genre!

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions.
